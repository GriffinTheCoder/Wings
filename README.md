Wings
=====

Wings is a multiplayer Flappy Bird clone.

### Install

  1. Download files and extract them
  2. CD into the directory and run `npm install`
  3. Run `node app.js` and you're off

Wings can be pretty buggy. You have been warned. You can also modify Wings to run on any server that is not localhost just by going to the `js/wings.js` file and changing the socket path from localhost to the URL or IP address of your choice.
